\description{
This function calls the AWS Textract AnalyzeDocument API (synchronous) to extract
structured data including forms (key-value pairs), tables, and layout from documents.
Note: This is a synchronous operation with a 5 MB file size limit. For larger files,
the function automatically converts the first 2 pages to PNG format.
}
\section{Warning}{

This function uses the synchronous Textract API which has a \strong{5 MB file size limit}.
For PDFs larger than 5 MB, only the first 2 pages will be automatically extracted and
converted to PNG format. For full document processing of large files, consider using
the asynchronous S3-based Textract workflow or an alternative service like Google
Document AI (20 MB limit) or Azure Document Intelligence (500 MB limit).
